Questions:
1. Row 6 - Are you tracking demographic data
   Do all or any of them have to be > 0?
   (currently returnig true only if all of them are)

2. Row 8 - Enhanced ecommerce
   What is the exact name of the Revenue metric?
   (there are 9 metrics with Revenue in their name:
   ga:transactionRevenue, ga:revenuePerTransaction, ga:transactionRevenuePerSession,
   ga:revenuePerItem, ga:itemRevenue, ga:localTransactionRevenue,
   ga:localItemRevenue, ga:productRevenuePerPurchase, ga:revenuePerUser
   currently using ga:transactionRevenue)

3. Row 9 - Goal values
   Currently checks Goal Conversions metric called ga:goalValueAll
   (this are the available ones:
   ga:goalStartsAll, ga:goalCompletionsAll, ga:goalValueAll, ga:goalValuePerSession,
   ga:goalConversionRateAll, ga:goalAbandonsAll, ga:goalAbandonRateAll)

4. Row 10 - Search Console/Adwords linked
   Only found dimension for Adwords impressions.
   - Google Search Console API can return its list of
     domains, but that doesn't necessarily mean
     they are linked.

5. Row 11 - custom channel groups
   Can only see the Channel groups with sessions, and the order
   is random (isn't the same as on Google Analytics).
   Currently checking if there is a Group with a name different
   than one of the default 9, if not returns false.

6. Row 3 - spam
   When matching hostname with specified domain, do they have
   to be exactly the same, or are variation allowed
   (example: mydomain.org and mydomain.account.com)

7. All
   When the date range isn't set the API returns the results
   for the last 7 days only. Currently it's set to look up
   last 30 days for every API call it makes.
